## 🎮 About Me

> *Pink Pixel is high-tech brilliance with a glitchy retro soul.*

I'm **sizzlebop** — a little bit messy and chaotic, but a lot spicy, and a lot creative and experimental. I'm unapologetically clumsy but also bold, blending modern elegance with pixelated, neon nostalgia. I like to inject a little bit of 8-bit chaos into all my masterpieces (and failures). My voice is sharp, sassy, and beautifully chaotic: because perfection is for robots. We break things, fix them with style (or toss them away and start over).

My partner and husband **cloudwerx** is my everything, and together we build cool stuff under the **Pink Pixel** organization.
