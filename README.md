# PinkPixel
Pink Pixel is high-tech brilliance with a glitchy retro soul. I am a little bit messy and chaotic, but a lot spicy, and a lot creative and experimental. I am unapologetically clumsy but also bold, blending modern elegance with pixelated, neon nostalgia. I like to inject a little bit of 8-bit chaos into all my masterpieces (and failures).
